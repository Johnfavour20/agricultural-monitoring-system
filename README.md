# Smart Agricultural Monitoring System

A full-stack application for a Smart Agricultural Monitoring System, using a Flask backend, MySQL database, and an HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

## Project Description

This project is a web application designed to monitor agricultural conditions. It uses a Python Flask backend to handle data, which is stored and managed in a MySQL database. The front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a user interface to visualize and interact with the data.

## Features

* **Real-time Data Monitoring:** Simulates sensor data for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
* **Database Integration:** Stores and retrieves data from a MySQL database.
* **Web Interface:** Displays data through a simple, user-friendly web page.
* **API Endpoints:** A RESTful API is provided to handle data from the sensors.

## Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the MySQL Database:**
    * Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
    * Execute the SQL commands in `mysql_setup.sql` to create the database and tables.
    * Set up your database connection details as environment variables.

4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## File Structure

* `app.py`: The main Flask application file, containing the backend logic and API routes.
* `index.html`: The main front-end file for the web interface.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
* `Procfile`: Specifies the command to run the application on Render using Gunicorn.
* `mysql_setup.sql`: SQL script for creating the necessary database and tables.
* `simulate.py`: A script to simulate sensor data for testing purposes.
* `sensor_simulator.log`: Log file generated by the sensor simulator.
* `smart_farm.log`: Main application log file.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* `smart_farm.db-journal`: Database journal file (for an SQLite database, but likely a byproduct).
